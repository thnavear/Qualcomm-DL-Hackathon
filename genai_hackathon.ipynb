They mention that the touchscreen isn't responding and sometimes doesn't register touch inputs, which is affecting the device's usability. They suspect it might be due to outdated Windows 10 drivers since they haven't updated recently. They're asking for help on how to update the drivers or troubleshoot the issue.

They mention unclear monthly fees and inconsistent amounts. They're asking for a detailed breakdown of the charges and whether additional features are included.

The user is reaching out to the customer support team, so I should consider which department handles such technical issues. Since it's about software functionality, it's likely either Technical Support or IT Support. But looking at the options, Product Support is also there. Hmm, Product Support might be more specific to the software product itself, so I'll go with Product Support.Next, the priority. The user mentions that the problem occurs inconsistently and they've tried troubleshooting steps without success. They're asking for help but don't indicate any critical impact or urgency.

The email mentions that the unexpected charges are causing significant impact on their budget planning and they're seeking immediate clarification.

The email is a request for an upgrade, which isn't urgent. There's no mention of any critical issues or time-sensitive matters. So, I'd classify this as low priority.The Language is clearly German, as the email is written in German. So the language code should be \"de\".Lastly, the Type.
